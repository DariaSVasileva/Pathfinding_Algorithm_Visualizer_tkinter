## Description:
This is the final project for [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). 
The program allows users to build a maze and visualize the process of finding the shortest path using either A\* or Breadth-First search algorithm.

## Technologies
Language: Python 3.8.5

Libraries used:
- [tkinter package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) (Tcl/Tk version 8.6)
- [queue](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html)
- [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)

## Features
1. Creating a maze by
	- drawing and erasing walls by clicking on the grid
	- placing walls randomly according to desired wall density
	- generating a circular maze
	- generating carved out maze
2. Finding the shortest path through the maze using one of two algorithms and visualizing the search process with desired speed of animation
	- A\* Pathfinding Algorithm
	- Breadth-First Pathfinding Algorithm
3. Reset the grid if necessary
